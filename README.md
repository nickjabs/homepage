<img src="CloudResumeArchitecture.jpg" alt="Cloud Resume Architecture">
In this project, I embarked on a transformative journey to revolutionize my resume by harnessing the power of Amazon Web Services (AWS). I leveraged various AWS services and implemented cutting-edge techniques to create a dynamic and innovative Cloud Resume that showcases my skills and achievements, leaving a lasting impression on potential employers.

AWS Services Used:

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service): Utilized for hosting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Its reliability and scalability made it ideal for delivering content efficiently.

Amazon CloudFront: Boosted website performance and global reach by serving content through a Content Delivery Network (CDN), reducing latency for users worldwide.

AWS Certificate Manager (ACM): Ensured secure communication and enabled HTTPS for the website, enhancing security and user trust.

Amazon Route53: Managed traffic routing to the CloudFront distribution, providing a professional and branded experience by registering a custom domain.

AWS Lambda and Amazon DynamoDB: Integrated Lambda to create a view counter, fetching data from DynamoDB to display the number of website visitors.

GitHub Actions: Streamlined development workflow and automated deployment to S3 whenever code changes were committed.

Techniques Implemented:

HTML for Resume Design: Leveraged HTML for a visually stunning and interactive representation of skills and achievements.

Cloud Computing: Hosted the website on AWS, making it scalable, secure, and globally accessible.

Serverless Architecture: Utilized Lambda and serverless services, eliminating infrastructure management and focusing on code delivery.

CI/CD Automation: Implemented GitHub Actions for seamless code synchronization and rapid iterations.

API Integration: Integrated a visitor counter API for real-time interaction and user engagement.

DNS Configuration: Configured Route53 for effective traffic routing and SSL certificate management.

This Cloud Resume project empowered me to elevate my resume with AWS services and modern techniques, highlighting the transformative potential of cloud technologies in the job market.
